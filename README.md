# Choice-Charities
Repository for Choice Charities initiative.
The Choice Coin Network plans to launch Choice Charities in Q1 2022. 
Choice Charities is an initiative geared toward allocating decentralized assets to charitable purposes. 
The goal of Choice Charities will be to identify charities and non-profit organizations that engage in democratic or other charitable causes.
Assets will then be allocated to charities based on votes by the Choice Coin Community. 
Holders of Choice Coin may also be able to use their Choice Coin for donations to these organizations.
